# arkki
Arkki is a client-server backup solution for Linux that aims to store files

  * Encrypted,
  * Stored off-site, and
  * Retrievable everywhere

## Encrypted

Arkki uses public-key cryptography (GPG) to encrypt backup volumes.  Thus, no
information is leaked even though somebody got
hold of the backed up files.

## Stored Off-site

Arkki stores backup volumes to a remote server.  Thus, your files are
protected against physical destruction of your hardware - be it fire, flood or
theft.

## Retrievable Everywhere

Backup volumes in Arkki are created with standard Linux tools and stored as
ordinary files onto a remote server.  As such, you can retrieve backup volumes
and recover files on every Linux computer even without Arkki installed.

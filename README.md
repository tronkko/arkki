# Arkki Bakcup

Arkki is a client-server backup solution for Linux.  Arkki is designed to
stores archive files:

  * Encrypted,
  * Off-site, and
  * Easily Recoverable

## Encrypted

Arkki uses public-key cryptography (GPG) to encrypt archives.  Encrypted
archives may be stored to removable disks or transmitted over internet.

## Off-site

Arkki stores archives to a remote server.  Thus, your files are
protected against physical destruction of your hardware - be it fire,
flood or theft.

## Retrievable Everywhere

Arkki creates archives with standard Linux tools such as gpg, bzip2 and
tar.  As such, you can recover files on every Linux computer even without
having Arkki installed.

    --quiet            Hide status messages and progress indicators
    --help             Show this message
```

## Configuration

In order to edit configuration, first create a configuration file as:

    arkki init

Configuration files are stored to .config/arkki directory in your home
directory.  Open the default configuration file to your editor and update
the file accordingly.


## Full Backup

Back up files to a directory as:

    arkki backup DIR

where DIR is a directory name where to store the archive.  Directory
argument may be omitted if you have set the output option in the
configuration file.


## Recover Files

In order to recover files from an archive, first copy the archive to your
local machine.  This expedites recovery as you may need to process the
archive a couple of times.

Arkki uses common Unix tools such as tar, gpg and bzip2 to create
archives.  Typically, you would list files in an archive as

    gpg -d ARCHIVE | bunzip2 -c | tar tvf - | grep PATTERN

where ARCHIVE is the name of archive file generated by Arkki and
PATTERN is a partial file or directory name.  Be ware that Arkki has
an option to omit encryption and use gzip compression in which case
the command would have to be modified accordingly.

Once you have identified the files or directories to retrieve, then
copy the file names and extract them from the archive as

    gpg -d ARCHIVE | bunzip2 -c | tar xvf - FILES
    
where FILES is one or more file names from the list.


# Installation 

Copy the arkki file from this repository and place to file to a directory
in your path.  For example, create directory bin in you home directory
and copy the file there.  Most Linux distros already add bin to your
path so arkki will be usable when you log back in.
